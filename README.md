### About me

#### Software developer with experience in full-stack development primarily focused on the back end. I have extensive knowledge in using the Laravel framework to create APIs and Vue.js for building dynamic and responsive interfaces. I also explore and study tools within the Laravel ecosystem, such as Nuxt, Inertia, Echo, and many others. I also have experience in competitive programming, where I developed significant skills in problem identificationand resolution using complex algorithms, techniques, and data structures.

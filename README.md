### About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Giuliano Maradei, a passionate Software Developer from UberlÃ¢ndia, Brazil. I specialize in full-stack development, with a strong focus on building robust APIs using Laravel and creating dynamic, responsive interfaces with Vue.js and Nuxt. My experience spans across integrating third-party tools like payment systems, AI technologies (e.g., AzureOpenAI), and optimizing user-centric designs for seamless experiences.

I thrive on solving complex problems, leveraging my background in competitive programming to implement efficient algorithms and data structures. Whether it's crafting CRUD operations, refactoring legacy code, or developing real-time multiplayer applications (like Typingbara), I enjoy tackling challenges that push me to grow.

Tech Stack: Laravel, PHP, Vue, Nuxt, Docker, Tailwind, Figma, AzureOpenAI, Cloudflare, and more.
